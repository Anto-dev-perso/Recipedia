# Privacy Policy

Effective Date: 06/10/2025

Recipedia respects your privacy.

This Privacy Policy explains how our app uses permissions and what information it handles.

## Information Collection and Use

Our app does not collect, store, or share any personal information.
All operations happen entirely on the userâ€™s device â€” no data is transmitted to our servers or any third party.

## Permissions Used

Our app requests the following permissions solely for essential functionality:

* android.permission.CAMERA: Used to access the device camera for (e.g., scanning, taking photos, etc.). No images are
  uploaded or stored externally.
* android.permission.INTERNET: Required only for basic app functionality such as accessing online documentation or
  resources. No personal data is
  transmitted.
* android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE and android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE: Used to let the app read and
  write files locally on the device when necessary (e.g., saving or loading photos). The app never uploads these files
  anywhere.
* android.permission.SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW: Allows the app to display overlays or floating elements, used only for
  enhancing user experience.
* android.permission.VIBRATE: Enables device vibration for user feedback or notifications.

None of these permissions are used to collect personal data.

## Data Security

Because no data is transmitted, no external data storage occurs.

All processing happens on the device, and users maintain full control of their data.

## Childrenâ€™s Privacy

Our app does not target children specifically, and it does not collect any personal information from anyone, including
children under 13.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy if the appâ€™s behavior changes.
Any new version will be published on this page.
