/**
 * SeasonFilterContext - Global seasonal filtering state management
 * 
 * React context providing global seasonal filtering functionality that affects
 * recipe search and display throughout the app. Manages persistent storage of
 * the user's seasonal preference and integrates with search/filter systems.
 * 
 * Key Features:
 * - Global seasonal filter state management
 * - Persistent storage of seasonal preference
 * - Integration with search and filtering systems
 * - Type-safe context with proper error handling
 * - Automatic loading of saved preferences
 * - Real-time state synchronization across components
 * 
 * Seasonal Filtering Logic:
 * When enabled, the app automatically filters recipes and search results to show
 * only items using ingredients that are currently in season, providing users with
 * more relevant and seasonally appropriate recipe suggestions.
 * 
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Using the context in a component
 * import { useSeasonFilter } from '@context/SeasonFilterContext';
 * 
 * function SearchFilters() {
 *   const { seasonFilter, setSeasonFilter } = useSeasonFilter();
 *   
 *   return (
 *     <Switch
 *       value={seasonFilter}
 *       onValueChange={setSeasonFilter}
 *       label="Show only seasonal recipes"
 *     />
 *   );
 * }
 * 
 * // Provider setup (typically in App.tsx)
 * <SeasonFilterProvider>
 *   <NavigationContainer>
 *     <RootNavigator />
 *   </NavigationContainer>
 * </SeasonFilterProvider>
 * 
 * // Integration with search logic
 * const { seasonFilter } = useSeasonFilter();
 * const filteredRecipes = seasonFilter 
 *   ? recipes.filter(recipe => isSeasonallyAppropriate(recipe))
 *   : recipes;
 * ```
